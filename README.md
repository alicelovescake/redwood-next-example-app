# Redwood Next Example App

## Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This example app is a school registration system using Redwood Web for admin interface, Redwood Api for all backend code, and NextJs for user interface.

The composability and flexibility of Redwood allows to to integrate with custom sides like Next to take advantage of SSR, ISR, and much more.
